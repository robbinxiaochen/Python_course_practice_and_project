1. Make a program that calculates the product of two matrices and prints it on STDOUT (the screen). The matrices are in the files mat1.dat and mat2.dat. Numbers in the files are tab separated. A matrix should be stored as an list of lists.
Advice: The program should have a function that reads a matrix from a given file (to be used twice), a function that calculates the product, and a function that prints a matrix. This way ensures that your program is easy to change to other forms of matrix calculations. Here are two links to the definition of matrix multiplication.


# High level pseudo code, description
make a function which can read the file and use a list of lists to keep track of matrix
make a function casulating the product of 2 matrixes
make a function printing a matrix to print the product

# Detailed pseudo code, using code elements
for each line in file
   split line into a list and append it to a list
retrun the list of lists

for i in length of matrix1:
  for j in row lenghth of matrix2:
      caculate the sume of: matirx1[i][j]*matrix2[j][i]
      append the sum to a new list

print the matrixes

2. Study the file dna-array.dat a bit. This is real DNA array data taken from a number of persons, some controls and some suffering from colon cancer. If you look at the second line there is a lot of 0 and 1. A '0' means that values in that column are from a cancer patient and a '1' means data are from a control (healty person). The data are all log(intensity), i.e. the logarithm of the mesured intensity of the relevant spot on the dna-chip. The data in this file will be used in comming exercises. Oh, yes - the data/columns are tab separated. The second item on each line is the accession number for that particular gene. 
Now make a program that extracts data from dna-array.dat. It shall ask for an accession number (unless you have given it on the command line). Make sure your program handles both situations. Then it shall search in the file for the data concerning that accession number. If it does not find it (you gave a wrong accession no), complain and stop. Otherwise it shall display the data in two tab separated columns. First column shall be the data from the cancer patients, second column for the controls. And yes, there are not the same number of sick and healthy people - be able to handle that.
